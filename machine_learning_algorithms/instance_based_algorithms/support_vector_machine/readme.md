# Support Vector Machines (SVM)

SVM's are used for classificaiton tasks, their goal is to define a hyperplane between two sets of features to identify their classes. The way this works is by creating a plane with a buffer zone, with the aim to make the buffer zone as large as is possible such that the plane is as far from each class as possible whilst still separating them, points on the buffer zone are called `support vectors` as they define the orientation of the plane.
