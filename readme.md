# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository
This repository is a comprehensive collection of all known machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm is accompanied by a detailed explanation of how it works, making it a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced practitioners in the field of machine learning.

## Contents
The repository is organized into different categories based on the type of machine learning algorithm:

Supervised Learning Algorithms: These algorithms learn from labeled training data and make predictions based on that knowledge.

Unsupervised Learning Algorithms: These algorithms identify patterns in data, grouping unlabeled data according to similarities among the examples.

Reinforcement Learning Algorithms: These algorithms learn to perform an action from experience.

Deep Learning Algorithms: These algorithms are based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.
