#Â Regression algorithms

Regression is formally defined as: 

> a measure of the relation between the mean value of one variable (e.g. output) and corresponding values of other variables (e.g. time and cost).

Informally it is a way to predict one value given a variety of inputs, regression can be linear (straight lines, planes and hyperplanes) **or** non-linear (curves or manifolds). Usually these methods contain minimisation of some metric of distance from a plane.
